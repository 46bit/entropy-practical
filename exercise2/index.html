    <h1 style="margin-top: 5px;">Exploiting Pseudo-random Number Generators</h1>
    <p><b>So you've looked into simple PRNGs in the last exercise. How to find patterns. What you need to understand is that all of these - LCGs, Mersenne Twister (as used for <code>random</code> in most programming languages you use) - are quite easy to predict the next value of when you're skilled.</b></p>
    <hr>

    <h2>Breaking a PRNG</h2>
    <p>As you saw previously, Linear Congruential Generators all have noticable patterns. They might have held up in the first chart and the list of outputs, but none looked random in the second chart. Even the ones that looked most random originally proved to have short low-order bit cycles.</p>
    <p>There are ways to disguise some of these issues, often using bit manipulation in a <code>twist</code> operation. But the best known of these, Mersenne Twister, which you <b>will</b> have used or use in future, is still terribly easy to predict the future outputs of.</p>
    <p>From 624 outputs of Mersenne Twister, you can recover the entire internal state and predict it forever. Fewer outputs than that narrow the range of possible outputs but are <i>slightly</i> less trivial to attack.</p>
    <p><b>If you're doing anything related to Security, you probably want to use a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-random Number Generator (CSPRNG).</b> This is still a PRNG, but it is designed to be hard to recover the internal state from the outputs. Hard in the cryptologic sense, with it hopefully taking longer than the age of the Universe to do it.</p>

    <h2>Using a CSPRNG</h2>
    <p>On a PC or a mobile phone, the Operating System has its own CSPRNG that your programs can use. This takes random noise on audio inputs, from tiny variations in thread switching time, from user interaction and all sorts of fairly random noise. Then it mixes that together and uses it to generate random numbers for you or me.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On Linux, read from <code>/dev/urandom</code>.</li>
      <li>In Python, use <code>random.SystemRandom</code>.</li>
      <li>Pretty much every programming language provides a way to get Cryptographically Secure random numbers from the operating system.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2>Seeding a CSPRNG badly</h2>
    <p>But on a little Embedded System, you don't have much of an operating system. You don't necessarily have user input or audio inputs or anything to seed a CSPRNG with without figuring it out yourself. So you might use what you have - a real-time clock - and seed a CSPRNG with that.</p>
    <p>Now it's still true that nobody can reverse your CSPRNG outputs into the internal state. But if someone knew the value of your real-time clock when you switched on the CSPRNG, they can figure out what the first output was. And the second. And every output.</p>
    <p>This can be bad for the person relying on the embedded system. So we're going to try breaking one.</p>

    <h3>Task Instructions</h3>
    <p>On the Virtual Machine, browse to the <code>~/randomness/exercise2</code> directory and run <code>./hex-lottery</code>.</p>
    <p>You'll be prompted to enter a guess - press Enter and it'll keep to the default <code>ffffffff</code>.</p>
    <p>Now it'll play the game and you're overwhelming unlikely to win. There's a 1-in-4,294,967,295 chance of winning.</p>

***       THE HEXADECIMAL LOTTERY        ***
***     Reward doubles every minute!     ***
############################################

*** This is MINUTE 5
    It's $32 a play
    For a $32768 jackpot!

:: Which 8 symbols do you want to pick? [ffffffff]

        7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
TO WIN  f f f f f f f f
DRAWN   0 5 0 2 5 b a 3

:: You didn't win! :-(</pre>
    <p>This seems kind of unfair to you. So you talked to your friend who builds Embedded Systems, and heard a rumour that the lottery is seeding their CSPRNG with the current unix timestamp when they start it up.</p>
    <p>You've also noticed that the jackpot doubles every minute, and it helpfully tells you which minute of the lottery you're currently playing. Which, assuming the Embedded System clock is correct, lets you guess the seed!</p>
    <p>If you open up <code>break-lottery.py</code>, there are instructions for how to go about this. Good luck!</p>
