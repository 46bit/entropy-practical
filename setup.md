# Randomness Practical: Setup
In time this will be on the virtual machine. For now there's just a few things to do before you start.

## Python Package Installation
```
pip3 install Tyche
pip3 install cp_randomness
```

**This uses Python 3.** If your system defaults to Python 2, you might need to use something like `easy_install3` or `easy_install-3.5`.

## Run the servers
```
./run.sh
```

Leave this running in the background. `CTRL+C` will kill it and all the child processes when you're done.
