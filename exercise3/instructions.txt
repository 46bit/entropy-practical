In the [Introduction](localhost:3000/introduction.html) (@TODO: Make link work forever) we discussed
building a PRNG from the last digit of sequential prime numbers (that is, `primes mod 10`).

1. Your task is to implement this. Write a function in your favourite language (e.g. Python) that outputs
   a pseudorandom digit starting from a provided prime.
2. Once the primes are above 10, your function will only output 1, 3, 7 and 9. Your challenge is to map
   this to pseudorandomly outputting any of the digits 0, ..., 15. Hint: this is an alphabet of 16 = 2^4
   digits, and you already output from an alphabet of 4 = 2^2 digits.
3. Now write a program that for a given sequence of outputs from (1) finds the lowest sequence of primes
   that could have given that output. If you have lots of time left, try to adapt it for (2).
