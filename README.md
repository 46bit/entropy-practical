# Randomness Practical: Setup
In time this will be on the virtual machine. For now there's just a few things to do before you start.

**This uses Python 3.**

## Python Package Installation
```
pip3 install Tyche/
pip3 install cp_randomness/
```

## Run the servers
```
./run.sh
```

Leave this running in the background. `CTRL+C` will kill it and all the child processes when you're done.

## Get started
Go to [The Introduction](http://localhost:3000).
