Python Package Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   cd Tyche
   easy_install .

**We use Python 3 for this.** If your system defaults to Python 2, you might need to run `easy_install3 .` or `easy_install-3.5 .` or something like that.

::

   cd ../randompy
   easy_install .

This should have installed all the packages you need.

Run the servers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   ./run.sh

Leave this running in the background. `CTRL+C` will kill it and all the child processes when you're done.
