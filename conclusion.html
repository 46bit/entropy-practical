<p>On the subject of function timing, timing several executions of the same function is often
helpful in eliminating system noise. However, do not assume that taking an average of the
timings is useful. Often it is simplest to take the minimum of a set of timings
as representative. It is possible to switch off garbage collection in Python while timing
functions, but this doesn&#8217;t remove all other system noise from the measurement.</p>
<p>There are often two issues related to errors: knowing what error has taken place and sidechannels
such as timing that allow an attacker to guess the error. The code that implements <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pwcheck()</span></code> deals
with the first of these, its header includes:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">#ifdef DEBUG</span>
    <span class="c1">#define ERROR_NAME_SHORT 1</span>
    <span class="c1">#define ERROR_NAME_CHARS 2</span>
    <span class="c1">#define ERROR_PW_SHORT 3</span>
    <span class="c1">#define ERROR_PW_CHARS 4</span>
    <span class="c1">#define ERROR_PW_LEN 5</span>
    <span class="c1">#define ERROR_PW_WRONG 6</span>
<span class="c1">#else</span>
    <span class="c1">#define ERROR_NAME_SHORT 1</span>
    <span class="c1">#define ERROR_NAME_CHARS 1</span>
    <span class="c1">#define ERROR_PW_SHORT 1</span>
    <span class="c1">#define ERROR_PW_CHARS 1</span>
    <span class="c1">#define ERROR_PW_LEN 1</span>
    <span class="c1">#define ERROR_PW_WRONG 1</span>
<span class="c1">#endif</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The unit test for the code must be able to ensure that all these errors are correctly discovered, so
when DEBUG is set a different error code is reported for each type of error. However, when the software
is deployed only a single error type is reported for any error.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this software is not as careful about timing and testing a single character at a time signals
where in the string the password is in error, allowing the possibility of discovering a password one character
at a time. There are two common approaches to resolving this problem; the simplest is to ensure that every test
takes the same time regardless of the input. This is easy to achieved in an approximate sense - e.g. every
password is hashed even if it does not meet the character policy - but less easy to achieve in the internal
calculations of the algorithm, as noted below for cryptography.</p>
<p>The second option is to confuse an attacker by adding random amounts of time to the execution of critical
functions. Since the time needs to be greater than the variance in the underlying process perhaps a
pragmatic approach is to try to ensure that execution times are approximately equal and then add random
fluctuations.</p>
<p>A difficulty with padding to a fixed time or random blinding is ensuring that any fake times are not observable,
for example if the attacker is able to observer a quiescant system due to padding with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sleep()</span></code>.</p>
<p>The simple timing attack used here should not be feaisble against a practical password system but such
techniques have been used against locks and some protocols, and they are an important part of an attacker&#8217;s
discovery strategy for injection attacks against databases.</p>
<p>A close relation to these attacks are more sophisticated side-channel attacks against cryptographic algorithms.
Consider this function, a common element of public key systems:</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="images/math/442817a8ffb0803793bbc33b6621dc87507352a7.png" alt="y = A^x mod B"/></p>
</div><p>The obvous implementation approach is to repeatedly square A mod B and if the relevant bit is set in x to multiply
this value into a result:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">res</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
       <span class="n">res</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">res</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">B</span>
    <span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">A</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">A</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="n">B</span>
    <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">x</span> <span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Each loop of the function squares A but peforms the second mod multiply only if a bit is set in x. An attacker
able to somehow observe information associated with the multiplications (power, radio etc) will be able
to determin how many bits are set in x, or perhaps even which bits are set. Vulnerabilities of this sort are proving
difficult to defend if attackers have near physical access to devices such as mobile computers and smart-cards.</p>

much more efficient than the best known cryptanalytic attacks ...&#8221;</em></div></blockquote>
